Calm Positioning

Overview
********

Nutanix has a unique value proposition for every business in the world. Increasingly, every business has a software organization and it must treat IT as a center of excellence or face extinction.

Our competition sells yesterday’s technologies and solutions, so we must change the discussion to engage the business unlike our competitors.
Does the business care about infrastructure details or how many years the sales rep has taken management to golf?
Sometimes yes, but increasingly in a competitive world: no.

.. figure:: http://s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/nucalm/image20.png

Instead the business cares about outcomes like: Scale, Agility, and Cost -- so we must frame our discussion in these terms to shut out our competition and change the way our customers conduct their business.
We must begin to leave HCI behind as it is commoditized and realize it was merely a stepping stone which places in front of customers today, but we cannot be box pushers anymore.
So every time we interact, we must add value to help our customers change and realize their potential. This must become a never-ending discussion for continuous improvement.
Not only will we change our customers to help them run their business in new ways, but we will capture them forever.
In doing so, NTNX will change our entire industry: NTNX firmly believes that no other company on the planet has this power and we want to help Nutanix capitalize on this potential.

NTNX Enterprise Cloud OS
************************

Calm extends the historical progression of hyper convergence across:
- Infrastructure
   - Storage
   - Virtualization
   - Microsegmentation
   - Applications
- Clouds
   - Hybrid, multiple on-prem and off-prem, public and private clouds
- Teams
   - Software/Application Developers
   - QA/Test Engineers
   - Data Center/IT/Infrastructure Operations

Placing the Enterprise Cloud journey in a historical context of Nutanix’s progression up the infrastructure
stack builds the bridge for our current IT, Operations, and Data Center customers to understand that Nutanix
has achieved a fully automatable 1-click, on-prem cloud with SSP and Prism Central. But we cannot stop here to achieve the Enterprise Cloud.

- Multicloud is good, but we need to justify and demo apps, lifecycle
- What problems are we solving and how do we approach as NTNX platform
- Then demo and recap
- VRealize especially
- Hit demo and high points

Positioning:
************

We have new audiences, new job titles, and new doors to knock on. Although they appear to be looking for different things from their point of view, we have a single platform solution for all to integrate their concerns and help them run the business together.
Most of the new audience does not care about HCI and increasingly, they control the budget and infrastructure choice.
Read the customer’s temperature, then change the conversation. Almost all in IT are afraid for losing their jobs to the public cloud and SaaS vendors
Ask why the app team is not in the room. Ask if AWS is.

.. figure:: http://s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/nucalm/image21.png

- Does the business care about:
   - infrastructure stacks
   - long vendor relationships
   - speeds and feeds?
- Increasingly no, because they care for business outcomes of:
   - Scale: ability to use and combine any solution
   - Agility: time to market for results
   - Cost: their byproduct yields TCO + OpEx savings


Cloud Discussion:
*****************

Change the discussion from HCI to Enterprise Cloud OS.  Public or Private Cloud:  Why not both?

- Enterprise Cloud = drive workloads to multiple clouds, enabling:
- Application Mobility: fastest time to market without lock-in
- Control Cloud Spend: blend clouds to reduce cost
- Universal Governance: budgets, approvals, and auditsacross multiple teams and platforms 

**Enterprise Cloud:** as a term was defined many years ago: http://cloudscaling.com/blog/cloud-computing/cloud-connect-2011-wrap-up/ (by Randy Jones, the same person who helped popularize Pets vs. Cattle)

Why not Public Cloud for all Workloads? 

.. figure:: http://s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/nucalm/image22.png

- App workloads can model power utilities: a mix of baseline demand + burst capacity.
- Public clouds are great for applications and workloads that have unpredictable or variable demands. For example, if a business launches a new online/mobile app (e.g., new online shopping experience, checking scanning app from a bank), the demand for the app or service is not well understood initially. In this case, public cloud allows businesses to ramp up resources for the app depending on demand. However, as the demand for the app becomes more stable/predictable, it is more economical to deploy on prem. Another example is applications such as month-end payroll systems or online shopping portals that have highly variable/seasonal demands with peak demands that are several times the average. This is why when NASA kicked off the Mars Exploration Rover mission, the event telecast was done on the cloud because the demand was unpredictable and highly elastic (a one time event)
- By not tying up idle infrastructure when not needed, businesses can save costs. But for more predictable or stable workloads, which is a majority of enterprise applications, public cloud services can be considerably more expensive than on-premises infrastructure
- Businesses want to balance owning and renting, choosing between private and public infrastructure depending on application workload characteristics. There are situations where it makes sense to rent, and others where owning is better economically
- If you’re going to a new city, e.g., Miami or New York and will be there for a week, you will look for a hotel or AirBnB. If you’re going to stay for 6 months, you’ll try to rent a place. But if you’re going to stay there for 3 years, it probably makes sense to buy a place and sell it later when you move


Identify where your prospects are on their journey.  Most customers are trapped in the lower-left quadrant by their vendors.

.. figure:: http://s3.nutanixworkshops.com/calm/nucalm/image23.png


Agility (horizontal, X-axis):
   from manual work
   to automated work
     
Scale (vertical, Y-axis):
   from single point of failure
   to resource fleets
   
Most are trapped in the lower-left quadrant by:
   Vendors sell more pain:
      Complex, specialized silos
      No or limited integration and
      automation for Enterprise Cloud

   Traditional approach:
       Hands on ops, single DC/cloud,
       without automation

Prosposect for Calm Opportunities:
**********************************

Find the value drivers and pain, ask for positive business outcomes and required capabilities:

- Do you have any automation today?
- Do you have a cloud or digital transformation strategy/initiative?
   - What clouds do you use or do you plan to use?
   - How much do you use in a typical month?
   - How easy would it be to use another cloud? PAIN: each cloud is a form a vendor lock-in and growing OpEx overruns
- Do you have an application development or software engineering team?
   - How do you make updates to production? 
   - How long does it take? PAIN: long time to market, complexity and failure, risk adverse culture
   - What is your technology stack or stacks? PAIN: fragmentation, increasing complexity and specialization which slows business

- What would success look like? on what timeframe and budget? and how would you measure success?
- How would the business react if: you could delegate application deployments to anyone?
- Would the business think it was magic if: you had budgeted, expiring, or scaling workloads driven by business KPM/KPIs?
- Do you want to be a force multiplier of your business so you can reduce your backlog, develop new skills, and advance with automation?

**Face melting questions:**

- What is the business cost in $ when you have 1 hour of downtime in production? 
- How much last month did your team fix problems after dinner: what would happen if you burn out your team and they left: how much manpower % would you lose?


Value Driver: Pain: Positive Business Outcome: Required Capabilities: Why Us?
